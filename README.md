# Mapiah

[Free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) graphical interface for [Therion](https://therion.speleo.sk/) cave mapping written in [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/).

## Main objectives

User-friendly interface to the powerful Therion mapping software.

As an intended side effect, it aims to completely replace xTherion, the venerable but ostensibly ancient Therion graphical interface.

Also create a thriving community of users and developers to make it as powerful and user friendly as such community needs and creates.

## Interesting characteristics

* Visually distinguish all point, line, and area types supported by Therion.
* Graphical interface for editing all supported options of points, lines, and areas supported by Therion.
* Multiple mouse and keyboard pan and zoom options.
* On save, original file lines are only changed if an actual edit modified them, which facilitates version control management.
* Uses Therion as the source of truth regarding supported features; i.e., if Therion supports it, Mapiah should support it as well.
  * As a secondary effect, tries to update and detail the Therion Book so it better reflects Therion features.
* Equivalent versions for Linux, Windows, MacOS, and web.
* Unlimited undo/redo.
* Redos available after some undos and new actions merged in the undo queue.

## Installation

### Linux

#### AppImage
Available at [Mapiah releases](https://github.com/rsevero/mapiah/releases).

#### Flatpak
Mapiah Flatpak version moved from Flathub to direct download from [Mapiah releases](https://github.com/rsevero/mapiah/releases).

This changed was necessary to automate the release process, which I still didn´t managed to do with Flathub.

#### Other formats
If someone is interested in creating Linux packages in other formats like arch, deb, rpm, snap or other package and is interested in my help, please contact me at rsev AT pm.me.

### MacOS
Available at [Mapiah releases](https://github.com/rsevero/mapiah/releases).

As Mapiah has no Apple compatible signing yet its necessary to allow special permission to run Mapiah in MacOS: [Open Any Way](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102445#openanyway)

### Web
There is a web version available at  [https://mapiah.org/webapp](https://mapiah.org/webapp).

[Officially supported browsers](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/faq#which-web-browsers-are-supported-by-flutter) for Flutter web apps.

### Windows
Available at [Mapiah releases](https://github.com/rsevero/mapiah/releases).

Apparently Microsoft Defender is keen on flagging unknown executables as having some kind of malware. Sometimes as [Bearfoos.A!ml](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/bearfoosaml-false-alarm/37707c6a-8222-44ad-a604-d75918dfb519), sometimes as [Trojan:Win32/Wacatac.B!ml](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/118430). Maybe others.

If you want to be extra sure, you can check Mapiah's setup exe file with some online virus scanner service before installing it.

## Reporting bugs

As is probably the case in all Free Software projects, the developers of Mapiah aim to produce completely bug-free software. And as happens in all software, they fail.

Please register bugs and enhancement suggestions as a [Mapiah Issue](https://github.com/rsevero/mapiah/issues).

When reporting bugs, please consider the following advice, which tries to make everybody happier:

* Check if the behavior you are identifying as a bug is actually a bug. For applicable types of issues, remember that Mapiah treats Therion as the 'source of truth.'
* If applicable, check if the Therion Book clearly defines the behavior you are expecting. If not, please consider submitting an update for the Therion Book.
* Remember that it is almost impossible for a developer to fix an issue the developer can't reproduce or at least see. To help with that, you can (should?):
  * Provide detailed steps explaining how to reproduce the bug;
  * Provide minimal files necessary to reproduce the bug;
  * Provide videos showing the bug (especially recommended for interaction-related issues);
  * Any other info that might help the developers visualize the issue you are reporting.

If you have some free time and want to see the above recommendations more extensively described, read [How to Report Bugs Effectively](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html). I read it a few decades ago and am still impacted.

## Changelog and Roadmap

## Name origin

_Mapiah_ comes from the (Brazilian) Portuguese word _mapear_.

In Portuguese, _Let's go mapping?_ is _Vamos mapear?_

In Brazil, it is usually pronounced as _Vâmu mapiá?_

As the internet doesn't deal well with accents, _mapiá_ became _mapiah_.
