Create the following methods for the current class:

* toMap,
* fromMap,
* fromJson,
* copyWith,
* hashCode and
* overriden == operator.

Use super as base for any methods where possible.

Include all parameters of the original class forCWJM constructor and use this same constructor in the fromMap and copyWith methods.

In case there are any optional parameters, include an extra makePARAMETER_NAMENull boolean parameter in copyWith.

toMap, toJson, copyWith, hashCode should include @override annotations.

Use jsonDecode(), not json.decode().

In the fromMap() method use 'Type.values.byName(map[TYPE_STRING_ID])' to get the type back from the map.

If there is a 'oppositeCommand' parameter, it should be treated as nullable.

Present only the created methods, donÂ´t return the complete class.
